# libparser
Parser functions written in Zig to learn the language and create a useful tool for myself for future projects
 -) Create a function that reads input from the Stdin
 
 -) Create a function that splits strings by a user defined delimiter (pretty much the example code on the ziglang.org homepage, but with undefined delimiter)
 
 -) Create a function that parses a string to an int/float (might be useless, the std.fmt.parseInt function seems to be pretty much ideal)
 
 -) Create the inverse of the prior function (might also be useless, haven't looked into the std for this yet)
 
 -) Make it all usable by the Zig package manager
